Hi Elad

1. The application is available at: http://164.92.173.203:8083

2. Once you login, there is a check vs. the DB ( is it existing OR new user )
3. On my application, you have 2x tabs opened on the browser:

- The game itself
- Info tab with the game rules and extra info

4. When proceeding with the game tab - once you collect your 1st prize, a panel of all players highest scores panel is revealed

5. You can run the game in 2x browsers: 1x regular run, 1x in Incognito mode to see the panel behavior

6. The scores panel is repeatedly refreshed from the DB, showing actual status of all players - in term of their highest scores so far

7. The player itself is marked yellow on the 'players scores panel'



Thank you for a wonderful course
